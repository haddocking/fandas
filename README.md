## Introduction to FANDAS 2.0

Fast Analysis of multidimensional NMR DAta Sets (FANDAS) is an analysis tool
 built on Python to predict peaks in multidimensional NMR experiments on proteins.
 FANDAS accepts a variety of inputs, with the protein sequence being the only minimum
 required input. The output generated by FANDAS can be opened using the NMR visualization 
software: SPARKY. Description of all the features that FANDAS offers is described in our 
publication described above.

## Installation

Installation is easier with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate fandas
$ python fandas.py -h
```
