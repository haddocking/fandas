## Introduction to FANDAS 2.0

Fast Analysis of multidimensional NMR DAta Sets (FANDAS) is an analysis tool
 built on Python to predict peaks in multidimensional NMR experiments on proteins.
 FANDAS accepts a variety of inputs, with the protein sequence being the only minimum
 required input. The output generated by FANDAS can be opened using the NMR visualization 
software: SPARKY. Description of all the features that FANDAS offers is described in our 
publication described above.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/haddocking/fandas.git
$ cd fandas
$ python setup.py install
$ fandas -h
```

## Example
```text
$ cd example
$ fandas -seq 1ubq-seq.txt -bt 1ubq-bmrb-tables.txt -exp_2d NH HN
